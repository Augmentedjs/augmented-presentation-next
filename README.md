**Augmented.js** is a javascript framework similar in concept to Backbone.js.  Augmented.js provides a large set of functionality designed to develop single pages applications easier.

The key focus of the project is to tie a number of missing features, patterns, and what would normally be third-party plugins together in a powerful framework.  Another goal of *Augmented.js* is to limit third party libraries for a smaller footprint, easy dependency management, and high performance.  Performance is a key item in the framework.  In every case the performance will beat other libraries and frameworks (such as jQuery) usually by large amounts.
